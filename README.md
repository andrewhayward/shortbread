Shortbread
==========

A self-hosted short URL plugin for Wordpress.



Installation
------------

Drop the `shortbread` folder into `wp-content/plugins`, and activate through the admin interface. Like you do.

Configure *Shortbread* under `Settings > Short URLs`. Yes, it would arguably make more sense to put these settings on the Permalink page, but given that there's been a bug [1] open about that for four years now, it'll just have to wait.
